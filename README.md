Bitcoin Volatility Shockwave

This project analyzes volatility shock regimes in Bitcoin markets and visualizes their nonlinear impact on option prices using an interactive Plotly animation.

 Motivation
Financial markets exhibit periods of extreme volatility where traditional price-based analysis fails to capture risk. This project focuses on identifying **volatility shock regimes** and understanding how option prices respond during such periods.

 Methodology
- Daily Bitcoin prices (2014–2023)
- Log returns and 30-day realized volatility (annualized)
- Shock regime defined as the top 5% of realized volatility
- At-the-money European call option pricing (Black–Scholes)
- Interactive visualization using Plotly

- Volatility dominates option valuation during market stress

 Tools Used
